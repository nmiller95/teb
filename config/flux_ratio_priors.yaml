### Adjust your parameters for the flux ratio prior calculations here.
# The size of search range should reflect the uncertainty on the parameter plus a little
# extra, e.g. at least twice the error bar. If unsure about whether to use lin or quad,
# check by plotting V-K colour against catalog temperature.
#TODO: Include option to restrict metallicity.
#TODO: Include option for single fit for stars with similar parameters.
